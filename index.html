            <h2>Your Free Spins No Deposit account</h2>
            <p>When registering an account, you will create your own unique username and create a password. The username and password is used to access our website and services. It is very important that you keep this information secure and private. You are solely responsible for any deposits and/or losses that may occur on your account. Note: We take no responsibility for any third party access to your account. Please inform us immediately if you suspect that there has been any unauthorised activity on your account. We accept no liability for any loss caused or transactions made on your account when your username and password has been entered, we will assume this has been entered by you.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for any wagers and all and any gaming transactions placed where your username and password have been entered correctly. You are responsible for the security of your username and password on your own PC or internet access location. If this username/password combination is "hacked" from your computer, due to any viruses or malware that is present on the computer that you access your account with, this is your responsibility.</p>
            <p>In the event that you forget your username and/or password, please click on the forgotten password link and follow the instructions. You will receive an e-mail from us allowing you to reset your security details.</p>
            <p>Once you have registered with us we may also ask you to provide further forms of identification as we deem necessary, so that we may carry out the appropriate identity checks as required by the UK Gambling Commission and the Alderney Gambling Control Commission.</p>
            <p>We will ask you to provide us with identification documents to confirm your age, identity and current address (the details of which you will already have supplied in your registration form), proof of payment method or any other documents/evidence we deem necessary in order to satisfactorily verify your account. We also reserve the right to request certified/notarized documents in order to verify your account. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to us confirming your age, identity and residence. We may also request documents in order to carry out a source of wealth check - more information on this can be found <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/source-of-funds">here</a>. We will keep a secure record of all identity checks carried out.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to withhold any winnings and suspend or terminate your account if any of this information cannot be proven.</p>
            <p>Access to the Website is permitted on a temporary basis, and we reserve the right to restrict or suspend your access to the Website or close it indefinitely. In such circumstances, subject to all due diligence checks being complete, your remaining Real Money balance will be repaid to you in full.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The identification information that you provide us on registration will be passed on to authorised credit reference agencies in order to confirm your identity and card details. By providing these forms of identification to us you agree that we may process, use, record and disclose personal information which you provide in connection with your registration and that such personal data may be recorded by us or them.</p>
            <p>To ensure the information we hold on you are always up to date, we may, from time to time, re-perform our verification checks.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We are required by our licence to inform customers about what happens to funds which we hold on account for you in the event of insolvency. More information can be found <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Your-rights/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Jumpman Gaming Limited holds customer funds in a client bank account which is separated from company funds. Customer Balances are not protected in the event of insolvency. This meets the UK Gambling Commission’s requirements for the segregation of customer funds at the level: Not Protected. In the event the status of customer funds protection changes, you will be required to accept such changes before any further game play is permitted.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You are limited to one account per person.</p>
            <p>You should log out when you have finished playing to ensure there is no unauthorised access to your account.</p>
            <p>It is your responsibility to check that all deposit and bet instructions are correct before you submit. We do not accept responsibility, nor will we be liable for any mistakes you make in this regard.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to void any winnings or cash-ins which are enabled by wins as a result of a technical malfunction or administrative error. A technical malfunction is considered to be a failure of any system or systems that would cause an error in the processing of a transaction such that the normal processing of that transaction is interrupted and unrecoverable. Any unexpected programming error or wrong data validation which gives different results than what is expected or required will be considered a technical malfunction for these purposes.</p>
            <p>Dormant Accounts: If you do not login to your account for a consecutive period of 12 months, your account will be considered a "dormant account". Prior to your account becoming dormant, we will notify you via the communication details registered to your account. Following your account becoming a dormant account, for security reasons we will suspend the real money balance remaining in the account to ensure it is safe and secure. This means you may not see your balance in your account if you attempt to log-in. Your rights to any remaining Real Money balance will remain unaffected and you can contact us at any time to have your balance restored. This may be subject to completing identity checks. If you have any questions relating to any of the above please do not hesitate to get in touch with our support team, who will be more than happy to help.</p>
            <h2>Closing your account</h2>
            <p>If you wish to close your account, you have the option to reopen it on request at any point in time. You can request an account closure by <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">emailing us.</a></p>
            <p>Such closure shall occur 72 hours after confirmation by customer support that your request has been submitted. If you login to your account prior to your account being closed, your closure request will be cancelled. Players are required to re-confirm their intention to close their account if they login within the 72 hour period. You accept that you shall remain responsible for any activity on your account between advising us of your notification and the closure of your account by us. If your closure request is related to responsible gambling, you should apply the tools mentioned in the Responsible Gambling section of these terms.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Closing your account renders the Games unplayable but with the option of them being accessed if you contact us. A closed account can be reopened if you contact us via email. You can also request to reopen your account by receiving a link to your registered email. This can be requested by entering your login credentials on the homepage while your account is closed.</p>
            <p>We are not liable for the non-receipt of any account closure requests. If you make a withdrawal and then close your account, we will not close your account until the withdrawal has been fully processed, and any deposits or bets made during that period will equally be valid.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Bonus Policy</h2>
            <span id="bonus-policy"></span>
            <p>‘Free Spins’ refers to spins on regular slot games.</p>
            <ul><li>
            <p>500 free spins are credited as 10 sets of 50 spins. Should you win 500 spins, you will receive 50 spins automatically. To claim your remaining spins, you must <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">email us</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Maximum bonus win of £8 per 10 free spins credited. Bonus winnings from free spins on slot games are not guaranteed because all spins are played and credited in line with the RTP for the game. You will receive between £0 - £8 per 10 free spins claimed.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The Welcome offer: You will receive a FREE claim of the ‘Mega Reel’ or 'Loot Chest' when you make your first deposit. Prizes vary, ranging from Free Spins to Amazon Vouchers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The Mega Reel or 'Loot Chest' is where you will win all your promotional prizes obtained through deposits on the site, after your first deposit. You will either be invited to play for FREE or pay a small amount to spin the Reel or open the Chest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you acknowledge that the Mega Reel and Loot Chest are a game of chance and therefore winning a prize is NOT guaranteed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>After making your first deposit, you can claim a free spin of the Mega Reel on each deposit of £20 or more. Note, you will not receive a spin of the ‘Mega Reel’ while you have a pending withdrawal (see description under the Banking Policy below) and it will not be made available once your withdrawal has been processed.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>If claiming a no deposit (registration) free spin offer you will receive 10 Free Spins only after registration once a valid debit card has been added.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>10 Free Spins only valid once per debit card. If you choose to close the 'Add a Card' pop-up upon completing registration, this is your choice and the 10 free spins no deposit promotion will not be made available or be re-credited to your account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Free Spins obtained through the Mega Reel or Loot Chest can only be played on specific games – chosen by the company. The games on which free spins can be claimed will be included within the specific marketing material for the offer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Amazon vouchers won from the Mega Reel and Loot Chest&nbsp;will be emailed to the address registered on your account within 7 days. We are not liable for the non-receipt of the vouchers. You are responsible for ensuring the email address on your account is correct. Vouchers will not be resent for any reason.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>You will not automatically receive the Mega Reel&nbsp;when depositing via the ‘Quick deposit’ option. If you wish to claim the Mega Reel, please <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">contact our customer support team.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>If you chose to close the Mega Reel&nbsp;or Loot Chest pop-up, this is your choice and the game will not be made available or be re-credited to your account until the next claim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>All bonus funds and Mega Reels and/or Loot Chests are removed from your account if your last login is greater than 7 days ago.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Wins resulting from Free Spins are credited to your account as ‘Bonus’ cash. Bonus winnings from Free Spins are subject to a maximum amount of £8 per 10 free spins, regardless of the accumulative winnings amount displayed. Due to maximum win amounts, you may not receive all the spins which are displayed as remaining to play.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The following applies to all Bonus funds obtained on the site, unless otherwise stated in the specific terms and conditions for a promotion. You agree by accepting these terms and conditions to wager 65x the amount of bonus won + any remaining wagering requirement prior to cashing out. If you decide to cash-out (withdraw) before fulfilling the wagering requirement, you will forfeit all remaining bonus funds, free spins, Loot Chest plays and Mega Reel spins. For example, if you win £10 bonus from free spins and your current wagering requirement is £100, this will result in a wagering requirement of £10 X 65 + £100 = £750. If there is no existing bonus in your balance or wagering requirement, the wagering requirement is calculated as £10 x 65 = £650.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Only bonus wagers contribute towards fulfilling the wagering requirement. Real Money wagers do not contribute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>You can withdraw your Real Money balance (subject to the Banking Policy below) but Bonus funds can never be withdrawn.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The maximum amount (for accounts that have made a deposit) which can be converted to your Real Money (withdrawable) balance as a result of fulfilling the bonus wagering requirement on a funded account is equal to lifetime deposits (up to £250). For example, if you have accumulated bonus funds of £400 once the wagering requirement has been fulfilled and your lifetime deposits are £50, then £50 will be transferred to your real money bankroll. The remaining bonus balance will be removed permanently. As another example, if you have accumulated bonus funds of £400 once the wagering requirement has been fulfilled and your lifetime deposits are £250 or more (for example lifetime deposits are equal to £500), then £250 will be transferred to your real money bankroll. The remaining bonus balance will be removed permanently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The maximum bonus conversion for accounts that have not made a deposit is £50. E.g. if you have accumulated bonus funds of £400 once the wagering requirement has been fulfilled, £50 will be transferred to your Real Money bankroll. The remaining bonus balance will be removed permanently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Winnings generated from your bonus balance will be accumulated to the bonus balance bankroll. Once the wagering requirements (65x) have been met, the remaining bonus (equal to lifetime deposits up to maximum £250) will be transferred to your Real Money (withdrawable) bankroll. All withdrawals are subject to the banking policy included in these terms and conditions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Winnings are credited to the balance from where the wager was taken. If in a single transaction you wager 50% with real money and 50% with bonus funds, any winnings will be credited to match the proportion of the original wager. E.g. A £3 total wager (£1.50 Real Money and £1.50 Bonus balance) results in a £10 win, this means £5 will be credited to each balance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Real Money will always be used to wager before bonus funds. You will only use your bonus balance when you do not have enough Real Money to place the wager.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The following games do not contribute towards fulfilling the wagering requirement: Blackjack (all variants), Roulette (all variants), any other casino style games or&nbsp;progressive jackpot slots. The company reserves the right to alter this at any time and without notice. Any changes in this regard will not impact any existing bonus or offers which have been offered to you, or have been already claimed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Bonus money wagering is not available on progressive jackpot slots, bingo, table games and live casino games.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>You can track your remaining wagering requirement on the withdrawal page of the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The company reserves the right to amend the wagering requirements on bonus funds at its sole discretion. Any changes in this regard will not impact any existing wagering requirements, bonus or offers which have been offered to you, or have been already claimed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>If you wish to permanently opt out of receiving bonuses, you can do this by contacting the customer support team.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>All promotional codes are only valid on the day the communication is sent out (up to 23:59 on that day), unless otherwise stated in the communication. This does not apply to the welcome offer, where a code is not required and there is no expiry of the offer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>On site inbox offers and promotions are only valid for the account they are sent to, as verified by the username and our internal send records. If the same device is used to access accounts belonging to different people, the username in the message indicates which person the offer is intended for and will not be available to claim for the other accounts.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>In the unlikely event of the Mega Reel, Loot Chest play&nbsp;or free spin credits malfunctioning, we will explore and offer a remedy to the issue if the query is submitted within 2 days of said malfunction. We must see a copy of the communication, with the date/time of when it was received clearly visible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>We cannot be held responsible for any promotional content sent out by unassociated 3<sup>rd</sup> parties, as verified by our internal send records. The sender name/email address does not guarantee the promotional content was in fact sent directly by us; if in doubt please get in touch with our support team who will be more than happy to verify whether the promotion is genuine. We are also unable to carry out SMS and/or email opt-outs for promotional content which has not been sent by us or by our approved affiliates, even if it arrives from the same send name/email address.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>We reserve the right to disable the crediting of all Mega Reel spins/Loot Chest plays/bonuses/free spins on your account. However, any existing bonus/free spins on your account will remain valid. We may do this if we feel you are claiming bonus offers excessively/for responsible gambling reasons.”</p>

Limitations are set as daily/weekly/monthly and you can do this by visiting the Responsible Gambling page or <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">contacting us via e-mail</a>.

            <h2>Imposed limits and Restrictions</h2>
            <p>In response to any interactions with you, we reserve the right to suspend or permanently remove your access to all Jumpman gaming websites where we have concerns that you are not in control of your gambling or deem you to be at risk of gambling related harm. This can take the form of imposed deposit limits, account cool-offs and removal of cashier access and gameplay. You remain solely responsible for all activity while your account is active.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Self-exclusion</h2>
            <p>If you are concerned that your gambling is out of control, you have the right to exclude yourself from the Games and you may do so by <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">sending an e-mail to us</a>&nbsp;with your instructions as to how long you wish the account to be inaccessible.

We will be unable to lift the block on access during the exclusion period. Any Real Money balance remaining in your account will be returned to you subject to completing any necessary verification checks.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Self-exclusion means that you will not be able to play any of our Games during the term of your exclusion. This measure will be applied to all accounts you hold with Jumpman Gaming within 24 hours. This means you will not be able to access or register to any of our sites during the time of your exclusion.</p>
            <p>If you decide to apply a ‘self-exclusion’ to your account, you shall not be permitted to open any new account with any Jumpman Gaming Site during the term requested. If you are in breach of your ‘self-exclusion’ (including within the first 24 hours), we shall be entitled to terminate any new account you open with any Jumpman Gaming website, forfeit any funds therein, and we shall not be liable to refund to you any funds you may have wagered or won through such account. Please see our Responsible Gambling page for more information regarding ‘self-exclusion’ and ‘cool-off’. Applying a self-exclusion will result in steps being taken to remove your name and details from any marketing databases used by the company within two days of us receiving a notification of your self-exclusion. We will also take all reasonable steps to prevent any marketing material being sent to self-excluded customers as soon as is practicable.</p>
            <p>At the end of your self-exclusion, your account will remain closed. Please <a href="https://www.freespinsnodeposit.casino/contact-us">contact us via email</a> if you wish to reopen the account. There will be a one day cooling off period before you can gain access to your account.</p>
            <p>If you choose to self-exclude your account, we strongly recommend that you request this with any other online gaming operators you hold accounts with.</p>

            <p>There may be occasions where we will have to suspend your account with us. In these circumstances, your funds may be temporarily unavailable for you to use or withdraw. This includes (but not limited to) any of the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul><li>If any chargebacks are suffered</li>
            <li>If you are in violation of these terms and conditions and monies have been played and won by a third party</li>

            <li>We become aware you have done the above at another website.</li>
            <li>You have allowed (intentionally or unintentionally) someone else to play on your account</li>
            </ul><p>We will attempt to complete any investigations and deal with them and the cause of such suspension as soon as practicable in the context of any legal or regulatory obligations that we may have.

            <h2>Bingo (90 Ball)</h2>
            <p><strong><em>How to play</em></strong></p>
            <p>90-Ball Bingo is easy to play. All you need to do, is select a room to play in and then pick which game you wish to play in. Ticket prices vary between games and rooms, so once you are happy with the price, just select the number of tickets you want to buy and ‘confirm’ your purchase.</p>
            <p>The game is easy to pick up, we will mark all the numbers off for you, and if you are lucky enough to be a winner, we will even automatically claim your prize and add your winnings to your account.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Tickets</em></strong></p>
            <p>Each ticket has 15 unique numbers on, ranging from numbers 1 to 90. These are the potential balls that will be drawn in the game. Each time a ball is drawn that matches up with a number on your ticket, it will be marked off, getting you nearer to a win. Numbers are spread over three lines, and split into columns of numbers. In column 1 you’ll always see numbers 1-10, in column 2, numbers 11-20 etc. You will never have more than 5 numbers per line. The aim is to get each number marked off per line, depending on the prize pattern in play.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Prizes</em></strong></p>
            <p>In 90-ball bingo there are three prizes to play for, the 1-line prize, 2-lines prize and finally the full house, or 3-lines prize. The 1-line is played first, you can win this prize by marking 5 numbers off of any line (top, middle or bottom of the ticket) before any other player. The first player or players to mark off the 1-line on a ticket wins the prize. Once that prize has been won, the game moves on to the next prize, which is the 2-lines prize. Here players are trying to get any 2-lines marked off their ticket before any other player (top and middle, top and bottom or middle and bottom lines). The first player to get 2-lines marked off their ticket wins that prize and the game then moves on to the final prize, the full house. The full house is won when a player is first to get all 15 numbers marked off on a ticket.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Split wins</em></strong></p>
            <p>It is possible for more than one player to win a prize, and even a chance that a player will win the same prize with more than one ticket they are playing with. The prize amount displayed for that prize type is always split equally based on the number of winning tickets. For example, if player A gets 1-line on two tickets at the same time as player B on one ticket and the prize was £15, then player A will receive £10 and player B £5.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Automatic voiding</em></strong></p>
            <p>The bingo system has an automatic voiding policy in place whereby each game may require a minimum number of players to have bought tickets or a minimum amount of money to have been staked for it to play out. Where the minimum settings have not been met the game will be automatically voided and any player stakes will be credited back to their account.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Progressive Jackpot</em></strong></p>
            <p>Some rooms or games of bingo may have a Progressive Jackpot included. This is an extra prize available on top of the full house prize. It can be won if a player gets the full house in under a certain number of ball calls. The criteria may be different per jackpot and will always be displayed in the bingo room. If you are unsure you can always contact customer services for more information. The Progressive Jackpot will go up based on sales and once it gets won, it will go down to the guaranteed seed amount for the next game it is available.</p>
            <p>Any winnings from a Progressive Jackpot may be subject to more detailed validation checks and accordingly may take longer to credit to your account or be processed if you have requested to withdraw the funds.</p>
            <p>You win a jackpot if you get the full house within a number of ball calls specified for each jackpot. You can find the number of ball calls needed within the jackpot name (i.e. “Progressive jackpot (40 calls)” refers to a jackpot that can be awarded when getting a full house in 40 calls or less).</p>
            <p>If more than one player qualifies for the jackpot they will receive a share of the jackpot prize based on the number of winning tickets they had that triggered the jackpot.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Malfunction</em></strong></p>
            <p>This game is played over the Internet which is a communication medium that is known to be imperfect. Messages to or from your display device and the game servers may be lost or interrupted. If you have wagered on a game but are unable to watch the draw take place the tickets will remain valid and in the draw.</p>
            <p>In the event of a disconnection or any discrepancy during a game, reconnecting and re-selecting the room/game should allow you to reconnect to the game to watch from the current point in the game. In the event a game has completed before the player is able to reconnect, any tickets purchased will still have been valid and any winnings due will be automatically credited to the players account.</p>
            <p>In the event of disconnection, the records stored on the game server shall be the final authority in determining the terms of any wagers you place and the circumstances in which they were made.</p>
            <p>In the case of any malfunction or evidence of any player infringement of the result of the draw, all bets and winnings are null and void.</p>
            <p>The purchase of Bingo tickets is final.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Free Bingo</em></strong></p>
            <p>The 'Free Bingo' room is only available for customers who have made a deposit within the last 7 days.&nbsp;</p>
